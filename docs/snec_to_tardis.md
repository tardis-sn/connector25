# SNEC to TARDIS conversion

## Outputs from SNEC

## Conversion to TARDIS

The SNEC output files XXXXX are ingested by the script XXXXXX.py and converted
into the required TARDIS inputs, a configuration YAML file and a CSVY file that
includes the 1D profiles.

## Inputs to TARDIS

- TARDIS configuration options: YAML file
- Density, velocity and composition profiles: CSVY file
- Atomic data: HDF file

To modify TARDIS inputs, make changes to the variables located at the top of the
file XXXXXX.py.
